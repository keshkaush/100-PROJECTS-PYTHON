# Python projects for practice

So if you want to run my projects or try yourself out please go :
https://replit.com/

as some of the modules are imported from there, like from replit import clear, to use clear screen method.
alternate to this is:

import os
def clear():
    os.systm('cls')
    
clear()  #just call this method to clear up your terminal.
